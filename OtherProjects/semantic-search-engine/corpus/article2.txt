Mechanics (from Ancient Greek μηχανική (mēkhanikḗ) 'of machines')[1][2] is the area of physics concerned with the relationships between force, matter, and motion among physical objects.[3] Forces applied to objects may result in displacements, which are changes of an object's position relative to its environment.

Theoretical expositions of this branch of physics has its origins in Ancient Greece, for instance, in the writings of Aristotle and Archimedes[4][5][6] (see History of classical mechanics and Timeline of classical mechanics). During the early modern period, scientists such as Galileo Galilei, Johannes Kepler, Christiaan Huygens, and Isaac Newton laid the foundation for what is now known as classical mechanics.

In the 20th century the concepts of classical mechanics were challenged by new discoveries, leading to fundamentally new approaches including relativistic mechanics and quantum mechanics.
