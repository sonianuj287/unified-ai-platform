GPU: Use CUDA-enabled PyTorch (significant speedup). Use --use_cuda when training. If you donâ€™t have GPU, reduce batch_size, hidden_size, and epochs.

Windowing & step size: You can use stride >1 to make fewer windows (speed tradeoff vs temporal resolution).

Thresholding: mu + k*std is simple and effective; more robust options: percentile threshold, isolation-forest on error scores, or dynamic thresholds using rolling statistics.

Multi-feature: If you have several features (e.g., CPU, mem, disk), change model n_features and dataset shape accordingly; use multivariate reconstruction error (sum of MSE across features).

Autoencoder improvements: Try GRU, bidirectional LSTM, attention, or Transformer-based seq2seq for better performance.

RCA: For root cause, measure per-feature reconstruction error and rank features causing high errors at anomaly timestamps.

Saving & loading: We save scaler.joblib and lstm_ae.pt so inference pipeline is deterministic.
